    "**What is a parameter?**  \n",
    "**ANS:**  \n",
    "A parameter is a variable within a machine learning model that is learned from the training data. It represents the relationship between inputs and outputs. For example, in linear regression, parameters include the coefficients that determine the strength of the relationship between features and the target. These parameters are adjusted during the model's training to minimize the error between the predicted and actual outputs.\n",
